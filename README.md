Alternate Text Web Application with PyTorch and ViT-GPT2
This project demonstrates a web application for generating alternating text for images using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model combined with GPT-2. Users can upload an image, and the model will generate a descriptive text for the image.
Features
Upload an image to generate a descriptive text.
Uses Vision Transformer (ViT) and GPT-2 for image captioning.
Supports both CPU and GPU (CUDA) for model inference.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask
PyTorch
Transformers
Pillow
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-web-app.git
cd image-captioning-web-app
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Flask web application:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Upload an image and click on "Predict".
The generated caption will be displayed on the result page.
Deployment
For deployment, you can use platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure. Make sure to update the host and port settings in app.run() for production deployment.
